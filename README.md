# Mock Robo Advisor

This is a minimal Flask web application demonstrating two flows:

1. **Scenario Investment** – enter a scenario and execute a mock trade.
2. **Feature Search** – search for companies by describing features in natural language.

Both flows use placeholders instead of real trading or data APIs so it can be run without additional setup.

Run the application with:

```
python app.py
```
